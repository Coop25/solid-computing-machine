Our Application goals:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are striving to create an intuitive user interface with a sophisticated design, that allows for the user to have personalization, efficiency, and security. 

Our application is designed for mobile devices, with the ability to be accessed on all operating systems. Our application may have its competitors; however, we strongly feel that the application we are innovating will be a stand out from the other applications that have minute similarities to “Safe State”. 

We are dedicated to the development of “Safe State”, by providing a remarkable product, that is user friendly, and of incredible valuable to the user and his/her family; 
A sense of security, that is priceless.




The Significance of “Safe State”
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We believe the statistics accounted for by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, solidifies the justification for launching the development of “Safe State”. We are relentless to build an application of value, that individuals and their family will want to utilize. 

 According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, these are the statistics for adolescents alone.

---- Missing Children Statistics----
In 2018 NCMEC assisted law enforcement and families with more than 25,000 cases of missing children.

Case type:
•	92 percent endangered runaways.
•	 4 percent family abductions.
•	 3 percent critically missing young adults, ages 18 to 20.
•	 Less than 1 percent nonfamily abductions.
•	 1 percent lost, injured or otherwise missing children.

Of the more than 23,500 runaways reported to NCMEC in 2018, one in seven were likely victims of child sex trafficking.




Detailed Description UI/UX Components and Data:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have designed the application to be extremely user friendly, clean, and sophisticated. One of our stand out features will be the SOS button that allows the user to activate the SOS button which is comprised of two actions; the piercing high pitched sound, repetitive bright flashing, and calls 911 alerting the nearest Police department. This feature is going to help an individual who encounters a dangerous situation, having no alternative option to get help.

The concept we are using is being “family oriented”, allowing parents the ability to know where their child may be when the child turns on their location function. A parent may have their child do this while they are at an amusement park with friends for example. Another concept is for individuals who may be alone often and feel empowered to be able to go for a jog in the evenings after work, allowing them to turn on their location, for another person in their life to be able to access, should something go wrong.

Schedule for completion of variable tasks.
We have coordinated to meet on “X” days, in addition to using all the hours given to us to work on it during class. We are using our time efficiently. Our communication amongst one another on the team is very strong, as well via group text, slack, and meeting in person. We like our team, and we want our app to be the best it can be.
